# Outputs information
`Graph.pickle` - previously built NetworkX multiDiGraph object (useful to eventually extract the network instead of rebuiliding it)

`Graph_structure.png` - network representation summarizing all edges' kind and direction between all different node types of the original knowledge graph (visualized to gain a general understanding on how to use data in the treatment of an immaginary patient)
